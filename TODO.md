# TODO: Fix Tool Navigation Issues

## Tasks
- [x] Correct paths in Home.jsx tools array to match App.jsx routes (fix case sensitivity and incorrect paths)
- [x] Uncomment and add missing routes in App.jsx (e.g., /edit-pdf, /pdf-to-pdfa)
- [x] Ensure necessary components are imported in App.jsx (EditPdf, PdfToPdfA)
- [x] Test navigation to verify all tool clicks work (completed via manual testing - all routes now functional)
