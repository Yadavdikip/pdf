# TODO: Fix Contrast Errors in ThreeDPDFViewer.css

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Change color: white; to color: #333; for buttons in control panel (.mode-btn, .feature-btn, .rotation-buttons button, .preset-buttons button, .page-controls button) to improve readability on light backgrounds
- [x] Change color: white; to color: #333; for feature card text (.feature-card h4, .feature-card p) to improve readability on light backgrounds
- [x] Keep white text for elements on dark backgrounds (e.g., .ar-controls button, zoom controls)
- [x] Test the page to ensure improved contrast and readability (attempted, but dev server issues prevented full testing)
