# TODO: Fix Upload Edit PDF Functionality

## Tasks
- [x] Update EditPdf.css to match JSX classes (file-upload-container, upload-area, editor-container, etc.)
- [x] Modify UploadEditPdf.jsx to re-render canvas after edits (addText, addWatermark, rotatePage)
- [x] Test PDF upload, editing, and download functionality (completed via manual testing - upload, edit, and download work correctly)
