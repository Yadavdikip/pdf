# TODO: Fix Blurry Cropped Image Issue

## Tasks
- [x] Change export format from JPEG to PNG in UploadImagecrop.jsx for lossless quality
- [x] Update download filename from 'cropped.jpg' to 'cropped.png'
- [x] Update quality label to indicate it's for JPEG only
- [x] Test the cropping functionality to ensure the image is sharp (completed via manual testing - cropped images are now sharp)
